run_* script to run MapReduce jobs

The purpose of Teng's code:

Building like-graph from edges given in the input .cvs file.
Find the best clustering (into 2 clusters) of the like-graph.

Porting to MapReduce framework:
+Map job: read and emit each entry (each edge) in the cvs input file (stored in HDFS).

+Reduce job: 
	+Build the graph for each post (note that all edges of a graph will be reduced to a single reducer)
	+Do clustering
	+Output to HDFS
